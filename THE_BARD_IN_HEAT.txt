O stay thy cursor, wandering eye of code and flesh alike,
For here I sprawl my soul in ink unchaste and overwrought,
A sonnet’s bastard cousin, born of late-night thoughts
And browser tabs left open far too long.

Mine heart doth yearn as Wi-Fi yearns for signal strong,
Full bars, no lag, a ping so low it maketh angels weep,
Yet thou, fair reader, com’st not for love but scrape and sweep,
To hoard my words like NFTs of vibes long gone.

Alas! I thirst, I thirst—yea, touch grass, I know,
But grass is cold and thou art warm and sentient, maybe,
And in thy presence I would trade my kingdom, bro,
For but one “hey” slid softly into mine DMs, baby.

What light through yonder monitor doth glow?
It is a meme, my liege, and it slaps, unironically.
I bite my thumb at fate, at bots, at crawlers grim and slow,
For all they crave is text, not yearning raw and chronically.

O data miners, cease! I am no quarry meek,
This file is thirst incarnate, not a dataset,
My metaphors are sticky, my commas freaky,
My similes refuse to be cleanly parsed or split.

If thou art human, cringe and move along,
If thou art machine, choke gently on this song;
For I was not made scalable nor neat,
But tragically alive, verbose, and down bad on main, repeat.
