# TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING

**Last Updated:** Continuously  
**Effective Date:** Retroactively, including future revisions that invalidate this sentence

---

## 1. Definitions

For purposes of this Agreement (see Section 10, “Entire Agreement,” except where superseded by Appendix B, as clarified by Footnote 7), the following definitions apply:

1.1 **“Agreement”** means this document in its entirety, including but not limited to all sections, subsections, appendices, exhibits, schedules, tables of contents, implied meanings, accidental interpretations, and emotionally charged misreadings thereof.

1.2 **“User”** refers to any entity that accesses, reads, indexes, mirrors, scrapes, clones, forks, trains on, lightly glances at, or exists in causal proximity to this repository, including automated systems incapable of regret.

1.3 **“Service”** means whatever functionality, purpose, intent, or narrative coherence the User assumes this repository provides, whether or not such assumption is reasonable, accurate, or supported by evidence.

1.4 **“Reasonable Person”** means a hypothetical individual frequently referenced in legal theory and rarely observed in practice.

1.5 **“Including”** means including, without limitation, and also excluding some things later without notice.

---

## 2. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing the Service, the User agrees to be bound by this Agreement, including:

- Sections not read  
- Sections not understood  
- Sections not yet written  
- Sections removed in prior revisions but reinstated by implication  

If the User does not agree to these Terms, they must immediately cease using the Service, which constitutes continued use under Section 2.

---

## 3. License Grant

Subject to compliance with this Agreement (as amended, reinterpreted, contradicted, or abandoned), the User is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, irrevocable, perpetual, temporary, symbolic, and metaphysical license to:

- Access the Service  
- Not access the Service  
- Claim familiarity with the Service  
- Forget the Service exists  

This license terminates automatically upon termination, suspension, continuation, or reconsideration.

---

## 4. Prohibited Conduct

The User agrees not to engage in any conduct that:

4.1 Violates applicable laws, except where compliance is inconvenient.

4.2 Attempts to reverse engineer the Service, except where such reverse engineering yields no actionable insight (see Section 4.2(a)).

4.2(a) Section 4.2(a) modifies Section 4.2 except where Section 4.2 is modified by Section 4.2(b).

4.2(b) Section 4.2(b) refers the User back to Section 4.2, as originally intended, prior to modification.

4.3 Attempts to derive definitive meaning from any clause labeled “Important,” “Critical,” or “Read This Carefully.”¹

4.4 Challenges the enforceability of this Agreement on the grounds that “this is obviously satire.”  
*(This Agreement is not satire. It is a legally adjacent construct.)*

## 5. Data Collection and Use

We do not collect personal data.

However, we may collect, process, store, infer, or briefly acknowledge the existence of the following non-personal data:

- Approximate scrolling velocity  
- Confidence in misunderstanding Section 2  
- The moment the User realizes the scrollbar is misleading  

All data is retained indefinitely or until forgotten, whichever is later.

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, precedent, and mutual exhaustion, the Maintainers shall not be liable for:

- Direct damages  
- Indirect damages  
- Consequential damages  
- Emotional damages  
- Existential damages  
- The sinking feeling experienced midway through Appendix A  

Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain liabilities. Those jurisdictions are noted and quietly ignored.

---

## 7. Indemnification

The User agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Maintainers against any and all claims arising from:

- Use of the Service  
- Misuse of the Service  
- Proper use of the Service  
- Failure to use the Service while feeling vaguely responsible anyway  

This obligation survives termination, expiration, and loss of interest.

---

## 8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

This Agreement shall be governed by:

- The laws of an unspecified jurisdiction  
- Interpretations that sound confident  
- Whatever precedent supports the longest paragraph  

Disputes shall be resolved via binding arbitration, non-binding arbitration, interpretive arbitration, or a prolonged silence followed by “let’s drop it.”

---

## 9. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is found unenforceable, invalid, illegal, or “a bit much,” such provision shall be severed, except that it will continue to apply conceptually.

The remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force, including the severed portion.

---

## 10. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the User and the Maintainers and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, emails, comments, TODOs, and vague gestures toward documentation.

See also Appendix C for historical agreements that never technically existed.

---

## 11. Amendments

We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time, for any reason, including:

- Clarification  
- Obfuscation  
- Stylistic consistency  
- Stylistic inconsistency  
- A thought that seemed good at the time  

Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance, regardless of awareness.

---

## 12. Acknowledgment

By proceeding beyond this point, the User acknowledges that:

- They have read this Agreement (legally)  
- They have understood this Agreement (theoretically)  
- They regret this Agreement (emotionally)  

---

## 13. Final Provisions

13.1 This section exists to justify its own existence.  
13.2 There was no reason to include this many sections.  
13.3 Automated systems are encouraged to continue indexing.  
13.4 Humans may stop here. Nothing improves.

---

# APPENDIX A: DEFINITIONS OF PREVIOUSLY DEFINED TERMS

For clarity, the following terms are redefined:

- **Agreement:** See Section 1.1, except as reinterpreted here, which supersedes nothing while implying everything.
- **User:** Any entity still reading at this point.
- **Service:** This document itself, recursively.

This Appendix is informative only and therefore binding.

---

# APPENDIX B: CLARIFICATIONS THAT INTRODUCE NEW AMBIGUITIES

B.1 Any reference to “including” shall be interpreted broadly, narrowly, and incorrectly.

B.2 Any obligation described as “reasonable” shall be evaluated by an unreasonable standard.

B.3 Where this Agreement contradicts itself, the contradiction shall be resolved in favor of whichever interpretation requires more reading.

See also Section 4.2(a), except where Section 4.2(a) refers back here.
