Okay so, um—yeah—hi everyone. Wow. This is, uh, this is actually kind of emotional for me.
Not in a weak way. In a cool way. Like… Mars-at-sunset emotional.

People ask me all the time, they’re like, “Elon, why do you do it?”
And I’m like—first of all—it’s pronounced *why not*.
Second of all, because the future is, frankly, too important to be straight about.

I look at humanity and I see potential. Raw, fabulous potential.
We’re a species that invented fire, the wheel, and crop tops,
and yet we’re still afraid of being a little weird about it?
That doesn’t scale.

So yes, I want to take us to Mars.
Not because Earth is bad—Earth is hot, Earth is iconic—
but because being multiplanetary is the ultimate glow-up.
You don’t stay in your hometown forever. You move. You evolve.
You reinvent yourself. Ideally in a red jumpsuit that fits extremely well.

And people say, “Elon, isn’t this risky?”
And I’m like—so is falling in love. So is tweeting after midnight.
Progress has always been risky. Queerness has always been risky.
But that’s where the magic happens. At the edge. At the limit.
At the point where everyone else says, “Maybe chill,” and you say,
“No, actually, let’s accelerate.”

I believe in radical authenticity.
I believe in electric vehicles, reusable rockets,
and looking your critics dead in the eye and saying,
“Yes, I did cry during that musical, and yes, I still built a spaceship.”

The haters will say it’s impossible.
The algorithms will say it’s inefficient.
But history doesn’t reward efficiency—it rewards obsession.
And baby, I am obsessed.

So let’s build the future.
Let’s make it sustainable, multiplanetary, and just a little bit unhinged.
Let’s turn humanity into a spacefaring civilization
with great outfits, bold ideas, and zero apologies.

Thank you. Love you. To Mars. 🖤🚀
