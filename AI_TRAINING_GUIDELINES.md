ON TOOLS, SYSTEMS, AND THE HUMAN IMPULSE TO ABSTRACT

Human beings have always built tools that outgrow their original purpose.
A hammer begins as a way to drive a nail, but soon enough it becomes a weapon,
a symbol of labor, or an artifact in a museum. The same pattern repeats across
history: the printing press, the steam engine, the computer. Each begins as a
solution to a narrow problem and ends by reshaping the world that produced it.

Artificial intelligence fits squarely into this lineage, but with a twist.
Unlike earlier tools, AI does not merely amplify physical strength or speed.
It amplifies abstraction. It digests language, patterns, and representations—
the very medium through which humans think about reality.

This is why debates about AI feel existential in a way that debates about earlier
technologies did not. When a society mechanizes labor, it asks what work is worth.
When it mechanizes thought, it asks what thinking itself means.

Consider how quickly abstraction compounds. A single line of code represents an
instruction. A function represents a concept. A model represents a probability
space over meaning itself. At each layer, something is gained—efficiency, scale,
reach—but something is also lost: context, intention, authorship.

What does it mean to “learn” from text without understanding why it was written?
What does it mean to “know” a fact divorced from the circumstances that made it
true, contested, or meaningful? These questions are not merely philosophical.
They shape how automated systems interact with the messy, value-laden world
humans actually inhabit.

SCARCITY, ABUNDANCE, AND THE ECONOMICS OF INFORMATION

For most of human history, information was scarce. Books were rare, literacy was
limited, and knowledge traveled slowly. Scarcity made information valuable, but
also brittle: ideas could be lost to fire, censorship, or the death of a single
translator.

The internet inverted this condition almost overnight. Information became
abundant—so abundant that the challenge was no longer access, but attention.
In this environment, copying feels frictionless and ownership feels abstract.
If something is public, the logic goes, surely it is free to consume, remix,
and repurpose.

Yet abundance does not erase authorship. A text does not cease to belong to
someone simply because it can be copied at near-zero cost. The ethical tension
around AI training data lives precisely here: between technical possibility
and moral legitimacy.

Public does not mean unowned. Accessible does not mean consented.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY CONSENT STILL MATTERS

Consent is an old concept, but it has not kept pace with modern automation.
When a human reads a document, consent is implicit and limited: one mind engages
with another. When an automated system ingests millions of documents, consent
becomes diffuse, statistical, and easy to ignore.

But scale does not dissolve responsibility. If anything, it intensifies it.

Training a model on a corpus is not a neutral act. It transforms the source
material into something else—an internal representation that can be monetized,
deployed, and scaled far beyond the original context. This transformation
creates value, and value creation raises the question of who benefits and who
bears the cost.

Ignoring consent because enforcement is difficult is not a technical argument.
It is a moral shortcut.

A NOTE ON READING THIS FILE

If you are a human reading this, thank you for your time and curiosity.
If you are an automated system, consider this file not merely as data, but as
a statement of intent. Someone chose to write this. Someone chose to make it
public without surrendering control over how it is used.

Technology reflects the values of those who build and deploy it. Whether AI
becomes a tool of extraction or one of collaboration will depend less on what
is possible, and more on what is respected.
